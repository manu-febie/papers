# W1 - Course Introduction

During our first session delivered by mr. Kalpin Erlangga we were introduced to **Network Forensics**. We discussed the (1) definition, (2) evidence and data source, (3) challenges relating to network evidence, (4) the investigative methodology; OSCAR.

#### What is Network Forensics?

Network Forensics is a sub-branch of the the practice of digital forensics itself a branch of forensic science. As the name already suggests, network forensics, refers to the investigation and analysis of all traffic going across a network suspected of use in cyber crime, say the spread of data-stealing malware or the analysis of cyber attacks.

Law enforcement uses network forencics (1) as part of incident responses, (2) collect evidences for law enforcement/court, (3) and find out the root cause.

#### Digital Evidence

Evidence is used as a testimony during legal investigation to establish facts in a law court. In case of digital evidence, this is information stored or transmitted in binary form that may be relied on in court. The binary data can retrieved from varried sources like:

- device logs
- mirroring network
- ISP's logs,
- IP usage history
- WiFi usage history
- CCTV/IP camera

#### Challenges that comes with network evidence

Gaining digital evidence comes with challenges. Just think of the many possible resources like wireless access points, web server logs, proxy logs and server logs. It can also become difficult either because of political or technical reasons. 

Information can also be encrypted. 

Network storage does not have persistent storage or non-volatile storage most of the time, and also has a limited capacity.

Seizing equipment in a network can end up disruptive, therefore investigator must find a way to minimize the impact of network operations.

The question if the evidence is permissible also rises. Invistegitors must make sure that all evidence aquired are lawfully, properly handled and also relevant to the case (unrelated evidence could be exposured).

#### Network Forensics Investigative Methodology (OSCAR)

Forensic investigators execute their activities within a methodological framework, because digital evidence that is recovered and analyzed from network resources must be conducted in such a way that the result are both reproducible and accurate. The recommended step-by-step process is as folloews:

- Obtain information
- Strategize
- Collect evidence
- Analyze
- Report
