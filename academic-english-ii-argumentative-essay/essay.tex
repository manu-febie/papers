\title{The Battle Against Gender Ideology}
\author{Imanuel Febie}
\maketitle

% MAIN POINT OR CLAIM: Biology only allows 2 sexes or genders
The term 'theybies' is adopted by some parents in the United States who have chosen to raise their children gender neutral, with the objective to let the children decide themself what gender they want to identify themself with \cite{raisingTheybies}. Nonbinary people are getting higher profile in popular culture, and multiple U.S. states and cities are granting gender-neutral classifications on either the driver-license or birth certificate \cite{nonbinaryGenderAwareness}. The ideology of a small percentage of people is being enforced while the actual science of the differences between the sexes and gender are being ignored or rather bended to fit the narrative of the non-binary community

% Body
% Claims -Your claims are the ideas you’ll use to support your thesis. For example, if you’re writing about how your neighborhood shouldn’t use weed killer, your claim might be that it’s bad for the environment. But you can’t just say that on its own—you need evidence to support it.
% --------------------------------------------------------
% - man and woman are biological different from each other.
Contrary to what present-day popular culture would like to have society believe sex is binary, and not a spectrum. Therefore sex has two available possibilities. For humans this is represented as either male or female. Likewise, masculine and feminine behaviour is dictated by biology \cite{personalityAndGenderDifferences}. Confusion often befall on the terms gender and sex, considering they are both related to each other and distinct \cite{psychosexualDifferentiation}. Certainly individuals may express themself, and those who identify themself as nonbinary have the right to express their gender. However, an ideology can not change biological traits, nor does the way an individual might feel about themself, in view of the fact that sex and gender typical traits is already established before birth. Generally people believe that sex is determined by our chromosomes or our genitals or hormonal profiles. Although not completely incorrect, sex is determined by two distinct reproductive cells called gametes. Gametes are also know as sex cells. The spermatozoan gamete is produced by the male and contains either the X or the Y sex chromosome, while the female produces the gamete called ovum only containing the X sex chromosome. When these two gametes unite in a process called fertilization, they develop into what is called zygote which contains two sets of chromosomes. The zygote XX will result in a fema while the zygote XY will result into a male. The Y sex chromosome carries the blueprint for the development of male testes \cite{endOfGender2020Soh}. Therefore, at vertilization the sex of the baby is already determined by the gametes. Certainly there are exceptions to rule, including intersex people, but rules are not made for exceptions.   

While the terms male and female are used to decribe the sex, 'masculine' and 'feminine' are the proper terms to describe gender.

% Opposition
% In your essay, you want to think about how the opposition would respond to your claims and respond to them. Don’t pick the weakest arguments, either—figure out what other people are saying and respond to those arguments with clearly reasoned arguments.
% ------------------------------
% - gender is a social construct
Progressives will tell that the differences between male and female are instructed upon us since birth by society, therefore gender is a social construct.

% Demonstrating that you not only understand the opposition’s point, but that your argument is strong enough to withstand it, is one of the key pieces to a successful argumentative essay.
% ---------------------------------------------------------------
% - refer back to the biological science behind science and facts
Manners that are deemed masculine or feminine certainly can be defined variously accross cultures.
 
% Conclusion
% Conclusions are a place to clearly restate your original point, because doing so will remind readers exactly what you’re arguing and show them how well you’ve argued that point.
% - only two genders exist
Although certain manners and behaviour can be influenced by the environment, this by no means suggest that gender actually is socially constructed. 

% Summarize your main claims by restating them, though you don’t need to bring up the evidence again. This helps remind readers of everything you’ve said throughout the essay.

% End by suggesting a picture of a world in which your argument and action are ignored. This increases the impact of your argument and leaves a lasting impression on the reader.
